tldr/moral of story
keep it simple. keep explaining it to the duck. google a lot. build time machine.

lordy, this took a long while with lots of back and forth. Tried to outline the html and do things section by section. I always spend too much time trying to get things "just right", when a simple solution is right in front of me (I still don't see it). Lots of googling on forums. adding useless code, but to me... it's safe than sorry? ehh...

I remember doing html with cool cursors and background music and wallpapers on geocities and it was easy. Or was it because I was younger?
